**Inclined Tube Manometer:**
Inclined tube manometer is a simple and cheap instrument that is commonly used for measuring differential pressure in a mine. It resembles to a U-tube Manometer. One limb is a tube of uniform bore (6 mm internal diameter) which is kept inclined at a low angle to the horizontal line. The other limb is transformed to a large reservoir with cross-sectional area 300-400 times larger than that of the cross-sectional area of inclined limb. Any change in the level of manometer fluid in the reservoir can be neglected in comparison with the change in fluid level in the inclined tube. Hence, a scale along the inclined limb directly reads pressure difference. For greater sensitivity, the inclined tube manometers can be filled with alcohol which also gives better meniscus than water. The instrument can be made suitable to measure a wide range of pressures by changing the inclination of tube. Smaller angle of inclination can be used for measuring lower range of pressures. In order to make the instrument suitable for use over a large range of pressure, arrangement is made for varying the inclination of the tube. For low-pressure measurements, a low value for the angle of inclination θ is chosen, whereas for measurements in the high-pressure range, the value of θ is increased. The pressure measured by such a manometer is given by the equation:
